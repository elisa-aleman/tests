# tests
Personal collection of examples and tests of libraries and how to use them. Dummy code dump folder.

Tests included:

* __Chainer__: a neural network library developed in Tokyo University. 
  Documentation is in english but the community that uses is it Japanese.
* __Tensorflow__: a neural network library developed by Google. 
  It is very verbose so I have a working example just in case I get errors in another project.
* __Tflearn__: a less verbose high level abstraction wrapper for __Tensorflow__.
* __SVM K-folds__: __scikit-learn__: I use scikit-learn to write my own K-folds method that returns F1, Accuracy, Precision and Recall.
  Included methods usually only return Accuracy or F1.
* __LDA__: __gensim__: I use gensim to do an LDA model based on probability distribution analysis, with the objective of topic clustering.
* __Stanford NLP POS Tagger__: Chinese part-of-speech tagging. I use my own library and test it out here.
* __MeCab__: A Japanese language parser, POS tagger and tokenizer.
